        In a world where technology shapes every facet of our lives, publishers
        are at the forefront of an ever-evolving landscape. The proliferation of
        digital content has led to incredible opportunities, but it has also
        created vulnerabilities that nefarious actors are keen to exploit. Fraud

        fraudulent tactics. Understanding these tactics is crucial for mounting
